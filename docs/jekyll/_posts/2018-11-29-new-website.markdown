The SCRIMMAGE website was moved from [WordPress](https://wordpress.org)
to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to reduce complexity. The website isn't
deployed automatically yet, but it will be soon. This will allow developers to
update the website via git commits and pull requests. We will eventually move
the hosting of these static html pages from BlueHost
to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
